abstract = {1st pbk. ed. Publisher Description (unedited publisher data) Markov chains are central to the understanding of random processes. This is not only because they pervade the applications of random processes, but also because one can calculate explicitly many quantities of interest. This textbook, aimed at advanced undergraduate or MSc students with some background in basic probability theory, focuses on Markov chains and quickly develops a coherent and rigorous theory whilst showing also how actually to apply it. Both discrete-time and continuous-time chains are studied. A distinguishing feature is an introduction to more advanced topics such as martingales and potentials in the established context of Markov chains. There are applications to simulation, economics, optimal control, genetics, queues and many other topics, and exercises and examples drawn both from theory and practice. It will therefore be an ideal text either for elementary courses on random processes or those that are more oriented towards applications. 1.

Pain threshold and pain tolerance were assessed using a testing-the-limits procedure. Furthermore, participants rated the subjective intensity and unpleasantness of tonic heat stimuli on visual analog scales and in a questionnaire.

Here, I describe a predictive, inferential perspective on interoception: ‘interoceptive inference' conceives of subjective feeling states (emotions) as arising from actively-inferred generative (predictive) models of the causes of interoceptive afferents. The model generalizes ‘appraisal' theories that view emotions as emerging from cognitive evaluations of physiological changes, and it sheds new light on the neurocognitive mechanisms that underlie the experience of body ownership and conscious selfhood in health and in neuropsychiatric illness.},

abstract = {This article provides a neurobiological account of symptoms that have been called 'hysterical', 'psychogenic' or 'medically unexplained', which we will call functional motor and sensory symptoms. We use a neurobiologically informed model of hierarchical Bayesian inference in the brain to explain functional motor and sensory symptoms in terms of perception and action arising from inference based on prior beliefs and sensory information. This explanation exploits the key balance between prior beliefs and sensory evidence that is mediated by (body focused) attention, symptom expectations, physical and emotional experiences and beliefs about illness. Crucially, this furnishes an explanation at three different levels: (i) underlying neuromodulatory (synaptic) mechanisms; (ii) cognitive and experiential processes (attention and attribution of agency); and (iii) formal computations that underlie perceptual inference (representation of uncertainty or precision). Our explanation involves primary and secondary failures of inference; the primary failure is the (autonomous) emergence of a percept or belief that is held with undue certainty (precision) following top-down attentional modulation of synaptic gain. This belief can constitute a sensory percept (or its absence) or induce movement (or its absence). The secondary failure of inference is when the ensuing percept (and any somatosensory consequences) is falsely inferred to be a symptom to explain why its content was not predicted by the source of attentional modulation. This account accommodates several fundamental observations about functional motor and sensory symptoms, including: (i) their induction and maintenance by attention; (ii) their modification by expectation, prior experience and cultural beliefs and (iii) their involuntary and symptomatic nature.},

Though there is no agreed on definition of chronic pain, it is commonly referred to as pain that is without biological value, lasting longer than the typical healing time, not responsive to treatments based on specific remedies, and of a duration greater than 6 months. Chronic pain that is severe and intractable has detrimental consequences, including psychological distress, job loss, social isolation, and, not surprisingly, it is highly comorbid with depression and anxiety. Historically, pain without an apparent anatomical or neurophysiological origin was labelled as psychopathological. This approach is damaging to the patient and provider alike. It pollutes the therapeutic relationship by introducing an element of mutual distrust as well as implicit, if not explicit, blame. It is demoralizing to the patient who feels at fault, disbelieved, and alone. Moreover, many medically unexplained pains are...},

abstract = {Disrupted interoception is a prominent feature of the diagnostic classification of several psychiatric disorders. However, progress in understanding the interoceptive basis of these disorders has been incremental and the application of interoception in clinical treatment is currently limited to panic disorder. To examine the degree to which the scientific community has recognized interoception as a construct of interest, we identified and individually screened all articles published in the English language on interoception and associated root terms in Pubmed, Psychinfo and ISI Web of Knowledge. This search revealed that interoception is a multifaceted process that is being increasingly studied within the fields of psychiatry, psychology, neuroscience and biomedical science. To illustrate the multifaceted nature of interoception we provide a focused review of one of the most commonly studied interoceptive channels, the cardiovascular system, and give a detailed comparison of the most popular methods used to study cardiac interoception. We subsequently review evidence of interoceptive dysfunction in panic disorder, depression, somatic symptom disorders, anorexia nervosa, and bulimia nervosa. For each disorder, we suggest how interoceptive predictions constructed by the brain may erroneously bias individuals to express key symptoms and behaviors, and outline questions that are suitable for the development of neuroscience-based mental health interventions. We conclude that interoception represents a viable avenue for clinical and translational research in psychiatry, with a well-established conceptual framework, a neural basis, measurable biomarkers, interdisciplinary appeal, and transdiagnostic targets for understanding and improving mental health outcomes.},

abstract = {By formulating Helmholtz's ideas about perception, in terms of modern-day theories, one arrives at a model of perceptual inference and learning that can explain a remarkable range of neurobiological facts: using constructs from statistical physics, the problems of inferring the causes of sensory input and learning the causal structure of their generation can be resolved using exactly the same principles. Furthermore, inference and learning can proceed in a biologically plausible fashion. The ensuing scheme rests on Empirical Bayes and hierarchical models of how sensory input is caused. The use of hierarchical models enables the brain to construct prior expectations in a dynamic and context-sensitive fashion. This scheme provides a principled way to understand many aspects of cortical organisation and responses. In this paper, we show these perceptual processes are just one aspect of emergent behaviours of systems that conform to a free energy principle. The free energy considered here measures the difference between the probability distribution of environmental quantities that act on the system and an arbitrary distribution encoded by its configuration. The system can minimise free energy by changing its configuration to affect the way it samples the environment or change the distribution it encodes. These changes correspond to action and perception respectively and lead to an adaptive exchange with the environment that is characteristic of biological systems. This treatment assumes that the system's state and structure encode an implicit and probabilistic model of the environment. We will look at the models entailed by the brain and how minimisation of its free energy can explain its dynamics and structure.},

abstract = {In this paper, we suggest that cortical anatomy recapitulates the temporal hierarchy that is inherent in the dynamics of environmental states. Many aspects of brain function can be understood in terms of a hierarchy of temporal scales at which representations of the environment evolve. The lowest level of this hierarchy corresponds to fast fluctuations associated with sensory processing, whereas the highest levels encode slow contextual changes in the environment, under which faster representations unfold. First, we describe a mathematical model that exploits the temporal structure of fast sensory input to track the slower trajectories of their underlying causes. This model of sensory encoding or perceptual inference establishes a proof of concept that slowly changing neuronal states can encode the paths or trajectories of faster sensory states. We then review empirical evidence that suggests that a temporal hierarchy is recapitulated in the macroscopic organization of the cortex. This anatomic-temporal hierarchy provides a comprehensive framework for understanding cortical function: the specific time-scale that engages a cortical area can be inferred by its location along a rostro-caudal gradient, which reflects the anatomical distance from primary sensory areas. This is most evident in the prefrontal cortex, where complex functions can be explained as operations on representations of the environment that change slowly. The framework provides predictions about, and principled constraints on, cortical structure–function relationships, which can be tested by manipulating the time-scales of sensory input.},

Rather than conceiving and studying them in isolation form each other it may be useful to locate them in an independently motivated, general framework, from which a principled account of how they relate can then transpire. Accordingly, these mental phenomena are here reviewed through the prism of the increasingly influential predictive coding framework. On this framework, conscious perception can be seen as the upshot of prediction error minimisation and attention as the optimisation of precision expectations during such perceptual inference. This approach maps on well to a range of standard characteristics of conscious perception and attention, and can be used to explain a range of empirical findings on their relation to each other.},

abstract = {Computational Psychiatry is a rapidly emerging field that uses model-based quantities to infer the behavioural and neuronal abnormalities that underlie psychopathology. If successful, this approach promises key insights into (pathological) brain function as well as a more mechanistic and quantitative approach to psychiatric nosology – structuring therapeutic interventions and predicting response and relapse. The basic procedure in computational psychiatry is to build a computational model that formalises a behavioural or neuronal process. Measured behavioural (or neuronal) responses are then used to infer the model parameters of a single subject or a group of subjects. Here, we provide an illustrative overview over this process, starting from the modelling of choice behaviour in a specific task, simulating data and then inverting that model to estimate group effects. Finally, we illustrate cross-validation to assess whether between-subject variables (e.g., diagnosis) can be recovered successfully. Our worked example uses a simple two-step maze task and a model of choice behaviour based on (active) inference and Markov decision processes. The procedural steps and routines we illustrate are not restricted to a specific field of research or particular computational model but can, in principle, be applied in many domains of computational psychiatry.

Significance Statement: We provide an overview over the process of using formal models to understand psychiatric conditions, which is central in the emerging research field of ‘Computational Psychiatry'. This approach promises key insights into both healthy and pathological brain function as well as a more mechanistic understanding of psychiatric nosology, which may have important consequences for therapeutic interventions or predicting response and relapse. In a worked example, we discuss the generic aspects of using a computational model to formalise a task, simulating data and estimating parameters as well as inferring group effects between patients and healthy controls. We also provide routines that can be used for these steps and are freely available in the academic software SPM.},

We propose that Bayesian models can be applied to autism - a neurodevelopmental condition with atypicalities in sensation and perception - to pinpoint fundamental differences in perceptual mechanisms. We suggest specifically that attenuated Bayesian priors - 'hypo-priors' - may be responsible for the unique perceptual experience of autistic people, leading to a tendency to perceive the world more accurately rather than modulated by prior experience. In this account, we consider how hypo-priors might explain key features of autism - the broad range of sensory and other non-social atypicalities - in addition to the phenomenological differences in autistic perception. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

@article{Firestone2016,
abstract = {What determines what we see? In contrast to the traditional " modular " understanding of perception, according to which visual processing is encapsulated from higher-level cognition, a tidal wave of recent research alleges that states such as beliefs, desires, emotions, motivations, intentions, and linguistic representations exert direct, top-down influences on what we see. There is a growing consensus that such effects are ubiquitous, and that the distinction between perception and cognition may itself be unsustainable. We argue otherwise: None of these hundreds of studies – either individually or collectively – provides compelling evidence for true top-down effects on perception, or " cognitive penetrability. " In particular, and despite their variety, we suggest that these studies all fall prey to only a handful of pitfalls. And whereas abstract theoretical challenges have failed to resolve this debate in the past, our presentation of these pitfalls is empirically anchored: In each case, we show not only how certain studies could be susceptible to the pitfall (in principle), but also how several alleged top-down effects actually are explained by the pitfall (in practice). Moreover, these pitfalls are perfectly general, with each applying to dozens of other top-down effects. We conclude by extracting the lessons provided by these pitfalls into a checklist that future work could use to convincingly demonstrate top-down effects on visual perception. The discovery of substantive top-down effects of cognition on perception would revolutionize our understanding of how the mind is organized; but without addressing these pitfalls, no such empirical report will license such exciting conclusions.},

@article{Craske2011,
abstract = {BACKGROUND
Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a chronic and debilitating medical condition with few efficacious pharmacological or psychosocial treatment options available. Evidence suggests that visceral anxiety may be implicated in IBS onset and severity. Thus, cognitive-behavioral treatment (CBT) that targets visceral anxiety may alleviate IBS symptoms. 

METHODS
The current study examined the efficacy of a CBT protocol for the treatment of IBS which directly targeted visceral sensations. Participants (N = 110) were randomized to receive 10 sessions of either: (a) CBT with interoceptive exposure (IE) to visceral sensations; (b) stress management (SM); or (c) an attention control (AC), and were assessed at baseline, mid-treatment, post-treatment, and follow-up sessions. 

RESULTS
Consistent with hypotheses, the IE group outperformed AC on several indices of outcome, and outperformed SM in some domains. No differences were observed between SM and AC. The results suggest that IE may be a particularly efficacious treatment for IBS. 

CONCLUSIONS
Implications for research and clinical practice are discussed.},

@article{Clark2013,
abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Brains, it has recently been argued, are essentially prediction machines. They are bundles of cells that support perception and action by constantly attempting to match incoming sensory inputs with top-down expectations or predictions. This is achieved using a hierarchical generative model that aims to minimize prediction error within a bidirectional cascade of cortical processing. Such accounts offer a unifying model of perception and action, illuminate the functional role of attention, and may neatly capture the special contribution of cortical processing to adaptive success. This target article critically examines this “hierarchical prediction machine” approach, concluding that it offers the best clue yet to the shape of a unified science of mind and action. Sections 1 and 2 lay out the key elements and implications of the approach. Section 3 explores a variety of pitfalls and challenges, spanning the evidential, the methodological, and the more properly conceptual. The paper ends (sections 4 and 5) by asking how such approaches might impact our more general vision of mind, experience, and agency.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {This study tested the hypothesis that fibromyalgia patients display hypervigilance for somatosensory signals. Hypervigilance was operationalized as the detection of weak electrocutaneous stimuli. Innocuous electrical stimuli gradually increasing in strength were administered to one of four different body locations. A reaction time paradigm was used in which subjects had to respond as fast as possible to stimulus detection by pressing a button corresponding to the correct body location. The detection task was presented first under single task conditions and subsequently under dual task conditions, in combination with a second (visual) reaction time task. It was predicted that hypervigilance would be most prominent under dual task conditions, where subjects can choose to allocate attention selectively to one of the tasks. Questionnaires on general body vigilance, pain vigilance, pain related-fear and pain catastrophizing were also administered. Thirty female fibromyalgia patients were compared to 30 healthy controls matched on age, sex and educational level. No evidence for hypervigilance for innocuous signals was found: patients did not show superior detection of electrical stimuli either under single or dual task conditions. Also, no differences were found between patients and controls on the body vigilance questionnaire. Detection of electrical stimuli was, however, predicted by pain-related fear and pain vigilance.},

@article{VanDamme2010,
abstract = {Attention is a key concept in many theories of pain perception. A clinically popular idea is that pain is more intense in persons who are hypervigilant for or bias their attention to pain information. So far, evidence for such bias in pain patients as compared to healthy persons is inconclusive. Furthermore, studies investigating the effects of distracting attention away from pain have shown contradictory results. In this review, we present a motivational perspective on attentional processing of pain that accounts for these inconclusive research findings. We argue that pain always has to be considered within a context of goal pursuit. From this perspective, two largely unexplored theoretical assumptions are introduced. First, when pain occurs during the pursuit of a certain goal, it may unintentionally capture attention although it is not relevant for the goal. Whether such unintentional attentional capture happens is not only dependent upon the characteristics of the pain but also on the characteristics of the focal goal. Second, attention to pain and pain-related information might be driven by a focal goal related to pain. Attentional processing of pain information will be particularly enhanced when the focal goal is related to pain management (e.g., attempting to gain control). Future research should systematically investigate the role of motivation and goal pursuit in the attentional processing of pain-related information. This motivational perspective offers a powerful framework to explain inter- and intra-individual differences in the deployment of attention to pain-related information.},

abstract = {Review of the literature shows that the common syndrome of chronic pain of uncertain origin appears to be perpetuated by central mechanisms. No plausible neurological theory has been proposed. While the alternative concept of chronic pain as a psychogenic disorder has remained a vague entity, there is strong support to view chronic pain as the prime expression of a muted depressive state. This form of masked depression, however, tends to be associated with a number of characteristic traits. Our studies of patients with chronic pain have led to the identification of a well defined psychobiological disorder with characteristic clinical, psychodynamic, biographic, and genetic features. This syndrome is termed the pain-prone disorder and is viewed as a variant of depressive disease. It proves a distinct entity when compared with a group of patients whose pain can be related to a well defined somatic disease. The chronicity of the disorder appears partially related to the practice of protracted, costly, and futile physical procedures, focusing on a phantom peripheral source of the pain-- a practice commonly pursued by patients and physicians. Recognition of the disorder allows for early, rational, and more effective treatment approaches.},

abstract = {An enhancement of neurotransmission of serotonin (5-HT), noradrenaline, or both, underlies the antidepressant response associated with most agents presently available to treat major depression. With respect to the 5-HT system, antidepressant drugs exert immediate effects on some neuronal elements controlling overall transmission, but it is the gradual changes in neuronal responses to such treatments that are ultimately responsible for producing their therapeutic benefits. In major depression, an increase in 5-HT1A transmission is thought to be a crucial determinant of the antidepressant response, whereas an enhancement of 5-HT2 transmission in the orbitofrontal cortex may mediate the therapeutic effect of 5-HT reuptake inhibitors in obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). The doses of medication and the durations of treatment necessary to obtain these alterations in 5-HT transmission in various brain structures of laboratory animals are fully consistent with the conditions in the clinic necessary to attenuate symptoms in depression and OCD. It is also possible that the relief of chronic pain produced by some antidepressants may be mediated, in part, by the blockade of peripheral 5-HT2A receptors. These observations emphasize the notion that the 5-HT system is endowed with different adaptive properties in various parts of the body, which, in addition to the multiplicity of 5-HT receptors, makes this chemospecific network important in many disorders.},

abstract = {Many millions of Americans suffer chronic medical conditions complicated by both depression and pain. Chronic pain disorders may be classified as being caused by one or more mechanisms, such as nociceptive (inflammatory), neuropathic (peripheral and central), and myofascial, each associated with a complex substrate of neurophysiologic changes. Specific treatment approaches have been developed for different pain mechanisms. Because all pain sensation is personal and subjective, all pain is affected to some degree by emotional states, and, therefore, by psychosocial factors. Major depression commonly complicates chronic pain and adds to impairment and disability. There is evidence that patients with depression occurring after the onset of chronic pain have the same rates of affective disorders in family members as in the general population, and significantly lower rates than in families of patients with major depression alone. This suggests that it is the stress of living with chronic pain, not personal or family predisposition, that causes depression in these patients. Optimal treatment includes treatment of both pain and depression, together with a focus on symptom control and functional restoration.},

abstract = {Perceptions may be compared with hypotheses in science. The methods of acquiring scientific knowledge provide a working paradigm for investigating processes of perception. Much as the information channels of instruments, such as radio telescopes, transmit signals which are processed according to various assumptions to give useful data, so neural signals are processed to give data for perception. To understand perception, the signal codes and the stored knowledge or assumptions used for deriving perceptual hypotheses must be discovered. Systematic perceptual errors are important clues for appreciating signal channel limitations, and for discovering hypothesis-generating procedures. Although this distinction between 'physiological' and 'cognitive' aspects of perception may be logically clear, it is in practice surprisingly difficult to establish which are responsible even for clearly established phenomena such as the classical distortion illusions. Experimental results are presented, aimed at distinguishing between and disconvering what happens when there is mismatch with the neural signal channel, and when neural signals are processed inappropriately for the current situation. This leads us to make some distinctions between perceptual and scientific hypotheses, which raise in a new form the problem: What are 'objects'?},

abstract = {Traditional views of visual processing suggest that early visual neurons in areas V1 and V2 are static spatiotemporal filters that extract local features from a visual scene. The extracted information is then channeled through a feedforward chain of modules in successively higher visual areas for further analysis. Recent electrophysiological recordings from early visual neurons in awake behaving monkeys reveal that there are many levels of complexity in the information processing of the early visual cortex, as seen in the long-latency responses of its neurons. These new findings suggest that activity in the early visual cortex is tightly coupled and highly interactive with the rest of the visual system. They lead us to propose a new theoretical setting based on the mathematical framework of hierarchical Bayesian inference for reasoning about the visual system. In this framework, the recurrent feedforward/feedback loops in the cortex serve to integrate top-down contextual priors and bottom-up observations so as to implement concurrent probabilistic inference along the visual hierarchy. We suggest that the algorithms of particle filtering and Bayesian-belief propagation might model these interactive cortical computations. We review some recent neurophysiological evidences that support the plausibility of these ideas.},

One fruitful approach is to build a parameterized stochastic generative model, independent draws from which are likely to produce the patterns. For all but the simplest generative models, each pattern can be generated in exponentially many ways. It is thus intractable to adjust the parameters to maximize the probability of the observed patterns. We describe a way of finessing this combinatorial explosion by maximizing an easily computed lower bound on the probability of the observations. Our method can be viewed as a form of hierarchical self-supervised learning that may relate to the function of bottom-up and top-down cortical processing pathways.},

abstract = {The slight perversion of the original title of this piece (The Future of the Bayesian Brain) reflects my attempt to write prospectively about 'Science and Stories' over the past 20 years. I will meet this challenge by dealing with the future and then turning to its history. The future of the Bayesian brain (in neuroimaging) is clear: it is the application of dynamic causal modeling to understand how the brain conforms to the free energy principle. In this context, the Bayesian brain is a corollary of the free energy principle, which says that any self organizing system (like a brain or neuroimaging community) must maximize the evidence for its own existence, which means it must minimize its free energy using a model of its world. Dynamic causal modeling involves finding models of the brain that have the greatest evidence or the lowest free energy. In short, the future of imaging neuroscience is to refine models of the brain to minimize free energy, where the brain refines models of the world to minimize free energy. This endeavor itself minimizes free energy because our community is itself a self organizing system. I cannot imagine an alternative future that has the same beautiful self consistency as mine. Having dispensed with the future, we can now focus on the past, which is much more interesting:},

abstract = {Chronic musculoskeletal pain is one of the most intractable clinical problems faced by clinicians and can be devastating for patients. Central pain amplification is perceived pain that cannot be fully explained on the basis of somatic or neuropathic processes and is due to physiologic alterations in pain transmission or descending pain modulatory pathways. In any individual, central pain amplification may complicate nociceptive or neuropathic pain. Furthermore, patients with somatic symptom disorders may have alterations in their psychological or behavioral responses to pain that contribute significantly to the clinical presentation. Genetic, physiologic, and psychological factors associated with central pain amplification are beginning to be understood. One important contributor to chronic pain is perceived stress and stress response systems. We and others have shown a complex relationship between the physiologic stress response and chronic pain symptoms. Unfortunately, treatments for chronic pain are woefully inadequate and often worsen clinical outcomes. Developing new treatment strategies for patients with chronic pain is of utmost urgency. This essay provides a framework for thinking about chronic pain and developing new treatment approaches.},

Outline of fear-avoidance model of exaggerated pain perceptions. Behav Res Ther 1983; 21: 401-408).ntroduced a so-called ‘fear-avoidance' model. The central concept of their model is fear of pain. ‘Confrontation' and ‘avoidance' are postulated as the two extreme responses to this fear, of which the former leads to the reduction of fear over time. The latter, however, leads to the maintenance or exacerbation of fear, possibly generating a phobic state. In the last decade, an increasing number of investigations have corroborated and refined the fear-avoidance model. The aim of this paper is to review the existing evidence for the mediating role of pain-related fear, and its immediate and long-term consequences in the initiation and maintenance of chronic pain disability. We first highlight possible precursors of pain-related fear including the role negative appraisal of internal and external stimuli, negative affectivity and anxiety sensitivity may play. Subsequently, a number of fear-related processes will be discussed including escape and avoidance behaviors resulting in poor behavioral performance, hypervigilance to internal and external illness information, muscular reactivity, and physical disuse in terms of deconditioning and guarded movement. We also review the available assessment methods for the quantification of pain-related fear and avoidance. Finally, we discuss the implications of the recent findings for the prevention and treatment of chronic musculoskeletal pain. Although there are still a number of unresolved issues which merit future research attention, pain-related fear and avoidance appear to be an essential feature of the development of a chronic problem for a substantial number of patients with musculoskeletal pain.},

abstract = {The present study examines two related issues. Firstly, is chronic low back pain (CLBP) related to a delayed habituation to an experimental pain stimulus? Secondly, are CLBP patients characterized by response specificity of the paraspinal muscles when confronted with a painful stimulus? CLBP patients (n = 22) and healthy controls (n = 21) received two series of 10 painful electric shocks. Subjective and physiological (SCR, HR, FPV, frontalis EMG, and paraspinal EMG) measures were obtained. No evidence was found for a global difference between CLBP patients and controls with respect to subjective and physiological habituation. However, CLBP was associated with physiological response specificity of the paraspinal muscles. Paraspinal responses to the pain stimulus were larger in the patient group than in the control group, whereas heart rate acceleration was smaller in patients than in controls. The physiological reponse pattern of the CLBP patients might be related to a more passive, helpless, and emotional way of processing pain. Whereas subjective experiences habituated, some physiological (including muscular) responses did not. This may play a part in the maintenance of CLBP. Theoretical and clinical implications of the response specificity are discussed.},

The present study used a tonic heat paradigm to assess early sensitization (15–100 s) to experimental pain in 30 chronic pain patients (15 musculoskeletal/back pain, 15 headache) and 23 healthy controls. Change in pain sensation during prolonged stimulation was measured by a dual sensitization method which combines subjective ratings and behavioural responses in an indirect psychophysical protocol protected against response bias. Phasic and tonic pain thresholds were measured for control purposes. The degree of sensitization was linearly related to stimulus temperature, and groups differed significantly in this "sensitization gradient': chronic pain patients sensitized earlier and stronger than healthy subjects, musculoskeletal pain patients showed the strongest effect. Pain thresholds were lowered in headache patients only. Discriminant analysis demonstrated good sensitivity and specificity of individual sensitization measures for distinguishing pain syndromes, particularly in combination with pain thresholds. The results are in accordance with current models of spinal plasticity contributing to pathological pain states. They argue for the diagnostic value of psychophysical measures of sensitization.},

Most previous findings were replicated: underpredictions of pain were followed by raised expectations of pain and increased fear of pain. In addition, the underprediction had long-term effects on fear of pain, uncertainty about predictions, and expected aversiveness of the painful stimulus. In contrast to previous findings and to Rachman's match/mismatch model, it was found that underpredicted pain can have dishabituating effects. It is theorized that inaccurately predicted pain can cause dishabituation, depending on the extent of the underprediction and on the subjective certainty of the prediction.

abstract = {The gate control theory's most important contribution to understanding pain was its emphasis on central neural mechanisms. The theory forced the medical and biological sciences to accept the brain as an active system that filters, selects and modulates inputs. The dorsal horns, too, were not merely passive transmission stations but sites at which dynamic activities (inhibition, excitation and modulation) occurred. The great challenge ahead of us is to understand brain function. I have therefore proposed that the brain possesses a neural network — the body-self neutromatrix — which integrates multiple inputs to produce the output pattern that evokes pain. The body-self neuromatrix comprises a widely distributed neural network that includes parallel somatosensory, limbic and thalamocortical components that subserve the sensory-discriminative, affective-motivational and evaluative-cognitive dimensions of pain experience. The synaptic architecture of the neuromatrix is determined by genetic and sensory influences. The ‘neurosignature' output of the neuromatrix — patterns of nerve impulses of varying temporal and spatial dimensions — is produced by neural programs genetically build into the neuromatrix and determines the particular qualities and other properties of the pain experience and behavior. Multiple inputs that act on the neuromatrix programs and contribute to the output neurosignature include, (1) sensory inputs (cutaneous, visceral and other somatic receptors); (2) visual and other sensory inputs that influence the cognitive interpretation of the situation; (3) phasic and tonic cognitive and emotional inputs from other areas of the brain; (4) intrinsic neural inhibitory modulation inherent in all brain function; (5) the activity of the body's stress-regulation systems, including cytokines as well as the endocrine, autonomic, immune and opioid systems. We have traveled a long way from the psychophysical concept that seeks a simple one-to-one relationship between injury and pain. We now have a theoretical framework in which a genetically determined template for the body-self is modulated by the powerful stress system and the cognitive functions of the brain, in addition to the traditional sensory inputs.},

abstract = {Because depression and painful symptoms commonly occur together, we conducted a literature review to determine the prevalence of both conditions and the effects of comorbidity on diagnosis, clinical outcomes, and treatment. The prevalences of pain in depressed cohorts and depression in pain cohorts are higher than when these conditions are individually examined. The presence of pain negatively affects the recognition and treatment of depression. When pain is moderate to severe, impairs function, and/or is refractory to treatment, it is associated with more depressive symptoms and worse depression outcomes (eg, lower quality of life, decreased work function, and increased health care utilization). Similarly, depression in patients with pain is associated with more pain complaints and greater impairment. Depression and pain share biological pathways and neurotransmitters, which has implications for the treatment of both concurrently. A model that incorporates assessment and treatment of depression and pain simultaneously is necessary for improved outcomes.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE To establish basic epidemiological data on chronic pain (duration {\textgreater} 3 months) in a defined population. Relationships between age, gender, and social class were tested. DESIGN A survey of pain symptoms, including location, intensity, duration, and functional capacity, was conducted by means of a mail questionnaire. SETTING General populations in two Swedish primary health care districts. Medical care was provided in a state health system. SUBJECTS A random sample (from the population register) of 15{\%} of the population aged 25-74 (n = 1,806). The response rate was 90{\%}. OUTCOME MEASURES Descriptive epidemiologic data in relation to objectives of the study. RESULTS Without sex differences, 55{\%} (95{\%} confidence interval, 53-58{\%}) of the population had perceived persistent pain for 3 months and 49{\%} for 6 months. Among individuals with chronic pain, 90{\%} localized their pain to the musculoskeletal system to a variable extent. Women experienced more multiple localizations of pain and had pain in the neck, shoulder, arm, and thigh to a greater extent than men. Prevalence of pain increased by age up to 50-59 years for both genders and then slowly decreased. The neck-shoulder area was the most common site of pain (30.2{\%}), followed by the lower back (23.2{\%}). Even in the youngest age groups more than one of four reported chronic pain. Blue-collar workers and employers (including farmers) reported chronic pain to a greater extent than other groups. In 13{\%} of the population, manifest pain problems were associated with reduced functional capacity. CONCLUSION Chronic pain symptoms are common but unevenly distributed in a general population. The results may influence planning and consultation in primary health care as well as warranting selective prevention activities.},

abstract = {Interoception can be broadly defined as the sense of signals originating within the body. As such, interoception is critical for our sense of embodiment, motivation and well-being. And yet, despite its importance, interoception remains poorly understood within modern science. This paper reviews interdisciplinary perspectives on interoception, with the goal of presenting a unified perspective from diverse fields such as neuroscience, clinical practice, and contemplative studies. It is hoped that this integrative effort will advance our understanding of how interoception determines well-being, and identify the central challenges to such understanding. To this end, we introduce an expanded taxonomy of interoceptive processes, arguing that many of these processes can be understood through an emerging predictive coding model for mind-body integration. The model, which describes the tension between expected and felt body sensation, parallels contemplative theories, and implicates interoception in a variety of affective and psychosomatic disorders. We conclude that maladaptive construal of bodily sensations may lie at the heart of many contemporary maladies, and that contemplative practices may attenuate these interpretative biases, restoring a person's sense of presence and agency in the world.},

abstract = {Computational Psychiatry aims to describe the relationship between the brain's neurobiology, its environment and mental symptoms in computational terms. In so doing, it may improve psychiatric classification and the diagnosis and treatment of mental illness. It can unite many levels of description in a mechanistic and rigorous fashion, while avoiding biological reductionism and artificial categorisation. We describe how computational models of cognition can infer the current state of the environment and weigh up future actions, and how these models provide new perspectives on two example disorders, depression and schizophrenia. Reinforcement learning describes how the brain can choose and value courses of actions according to their long-term future value. Some depressive symptoms may result from aberrant valuations, which could arise from prior beliefs about the loss of agency ('helplessness'), or from an inability to inhibit the mental exploration of aversive events. Predictive coding explains how the brain might perform Bayesian inference about the state of its environment by combining sensory data with prior beliefs, each weighted according to their certainty (or precision). Several cortical abnormalities in schizophrenia might reduce precision at higher levels of the inferential hierarchy, biasing inference towards sensory data and away from prior beliefs. We discuss whether striatal hyperdopaminergia might have an adaptive function in this context, and also how reinforcement learning and incentive salience models may shed light on the disorder. Finally, we review some of Computational Psychiatry's applications to neurological disorders, such as Parkinson's disease, and some pitfalls to avoid when applying its methods.},

This invaluable new resource presents a state-of the-art account of the psychology of pain from the leading researchers. It features contributions from clinical, social, and biopsychological perspectives, the latest theories of pain, as well as basic processes and applied issue. The book opens with an introduction to the history of pain theory and the epidemiology of pain. It then explores theoretical work including the gate control theory/neuromatrix model, as well as biopsychosocial, cognitive/behavioral, and psychodynamic perspectives. Issues such as the link between psychophysiological processes and consciousness and the communication of pain are examined. Pain over the life span including child and adult pain, pain in the elderly, and ethno-cultural and individual differences are the focus of the next three chapters. The final sections of the book address current clinical issues such as pain assessment and acute chronic pain interventions, the unavailability of psychological interventions for chronic pain in a number of settings, the use of self-report and issues related to the implementation of certain biomedical interventions, and the latest ethical standards and the theories on which these standards are based.

First, we briefly review the impact of chronic pain on society and address current pitfalls of its definition and clinical management. Second, we examine pain mechanisms via nociceptive information transmission cephalad and its impact and interaction with the cortex. Third, we present recent discoveries on the active role of the cortex in chronic pain, with findings indicating that the human cortex continuously reorganizes as it lives in chronic pain. We also introduce data emphasizing that distinct chronic pain conditions impact on the cortex in unique patterns. Fourth, animal studies regarding nociceptive transmission, recent evidence for supraspinal reorganization during pain, the necessity of descending modulation for maintenance of neuropathic behavior, and the impact of cortical manipulations on neuropathic pain is also reviewed. We further expound on the notion that chronic pain can be reformulated within the context of learning and memory, and demonstrate the relevance of the idea in the design of novel pharmacotherapies. Lastly, we integrate the human and animal data into a unified working model outlining the mechanism by which acute pain transitions into a chronic state. It incorporates knowledge of underlying brain structures and their reorganization, and also includes specific variations as a function of pain persistence and injury type, thereby providing mechanistic descriptions of several unique chronic pain conditions within a single model.},

abstract = {Plasticity enables alterations in transmission in nociceptive systems. It is this plasticity in the nervous system that can alter the linear relation between noxious stimuli and the perception of pain. In this way, a number of CNS mechanisms can alter neuronal activity, leading to abnormal ongoing and stimulus-evoked pains due to peripheral and central changes. Peripheral nerves can become sensitized, spinal cord neurons can be rendered hyperexcitable and ascending projections to higher centres can further trigger changes in descending controls from the midbrain and brainstem. Together, these changes, all of which appear to involve reversible physiological and pharmacological plasticity, can alter the relationship between an applied stimulus and the perceived response and so lead to persistent pain states.},

abstract = {Pain is an unpleasant experience that results from both physical and psychological responses to injury. A complex set of pathways transmits pain messages from the periphery to the central nervous system, where control occurs from higher centres. Primary afferent pain fibres synapse with second-order neurons in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord. Ascending spinothalamic and spinoreticular tracts convey pain up to the brain, where pain signals are processed by the thalamus and sent to the cortex. Descending tracts, via the midbrain periaquaductal grey and nucleus raphe magnus, have a role in pain modulation. When nerves are damaged, neuropathic pain results and various mechanisms have been proposed for how this takes place. These mechanisms involve both peripheral and central sensitization.},

However, decision makers have tended to concentrate their attention on a very minor component of the cost burden, namely prescription costs, which, in the case of back pain, represent 1{\%} of the total cost burden. In addition to its economic impact, chronic pain is probably one of the diseases with the greatest negative impact on quality of life.

abstract = {OBJECTIVE This study compared changes in bodily pain, health-related quality of life (HRQoL), and psychological symptoms during an 8-week mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) program among groups of participants with different chronic pain conditions. METHODS From 1997-2003, a longitudinal investigation of chronic pain patients (n=133) was nested within a larger prospective cohort study of heterogeneous patients participating in MBSR at a university-based Integrative Medicine center. Measures included the Short-Form 36 Health Survey and Symptom Checklist-90-Revised. Paired t tests were used to compare pre-post changes on outcome measures. Differences in treatment effect sizes were compared as a function of chronic pain condition. Correlations were examined between outcome parameters and home meditation practice. RESULTS Outcomes differed in significance and magnitude across common chronic pain conditions. Diagnostic subgroups of patients with arthritis, back/neck pain, or two or more comorbid pain conditions demonstrated a significant change in pain intensity and functional limitations due to pain following MBSR. Participants with arthritis showed the largest treatment effects for HRQoL and psychological distress. Patients with chronic headache/migraine experienced the smallest improvement in pain and HRQoL. Patients with fibromyalgia had the smallest improvement in psychological distress. Greater home meditation practice was associated with improvement on several outcome measures, including overall psychological distress, somatization symptoms, and self-rated health, but not pain and other quality of life scales. CONCLUSION MBSR treatment effects on pain, HRQoL and psychological well-being vary as a function of chronic pain condition and compliance with home meditation practice.},

abstract = {The practice of mindfulness meditation was used in a 10-week Stress Reduction and Relaxation Program to train chronic pain patients in self-regulation. The meditation facilitates an attentional stance towards proprioception known as detached observation. This appears to cause an “uncoupling” of the sensory dimension of the pain experience from the affectivel evaluative alarm reaction and reduce the experience of suffering via cognitive reappraisal. Data are presented on 51 chronic pain patients who had not improved with traditional medical care. The dominant pain categories were low back, neck and shoulder, and headache. Facial pain, angina pectoris, noncoronary chest pain, and GI pain were also represented. At 10 weeks, 65{\%} of the patients showed a reduction of ≥33{\%} in the mean total Pain Rating Index (Melzack) and 50{\%} showed a reduction of ≥50{\%}. Similar decreases were recorded on other pain indices and in the number of medical symptoms reported. Large and significant reductions in mood disturbance and psychiatric symptomatology accompanied these changes and were relatively stable on follow-up. These improvements were independent of the pain category. We conclude that this form of meditation can be used as the basis for an effective behavioral program in self-regulation for chronic pain patients. Key features of the program structure, and the limitations of the present uncontrolled study are discussed.},

This manuscript reviews key aspects which support understanding the development of pediatric chronic pain, points to the current pediatric chronic pain terminology, addresses effective treatment strategies, and discusses the evidence-based use of pharmacology. Common symptoms of an underlying pain vulnerability present in the three most common chronic pain disorders in pediatrics: primary headaches, centrally mediated abdominal pain syndromes, and/or chronic/recurrent musculoskeletal and joint pain. A significant number of children with repeated acute nociceptive pain episodes develop chronic pain in addition to or as a result of their underlying medical condition “chronic-on-acute pain.” We provide description of the structure and process of our interdisciplinary, rehabilitative pain clinic in Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA with accompanying data in the treatment of chronic pain symptoms that persist beyond the expected time of healing. An interdisciplinary approach combining (1) rehabilitation; (2) integrative medicine/active mind-body techniques; (3) psychology; and (4) normalizing daily school attendance, sports, social life and sleep will be presented. As a result of restored function, pain improves and commonly resolves. Opioids are not indicated for primary pain disorders, and other medications, with few exceptions, are usually not first-line therapy.},

abstract = {UNLABELLED A cross-sectional, Internet-based survey was conducted in a nationally representative sample of United States (US) adults to estimate the point prevalence of chronic pain and to describe sociodemographic correlates and characteristics of chronic pain. The survey was distributed to 35,718 members (aged 18 years and older) of a Web-enabled panel that is representative of the US population, and 27,035 individuals responded. Crude and weighted prevalence estimates were calculated and stratified by age, sex, and type of chronic pain. The weighted point-prevalence of chronic pain (defined as chronic, recurrent, or long-lasting pain lasting for at least 6 months) was 30.7{\%} (95{\%} CI, 29.8-31.7). Prevalence was higher for females (34.3{\%}) than males (26.7{\%}) and increased with age. The weighted prevalence of primary chronic lower back pain was 8.1{\%} and primary osteoarthritis pain was 3.9{\%}. Half of respondents with chronic pain experienced daily pain, and average (past 3 months) pain intensity was severe (≥ 7 on a scale ranging from 0 to 10) for 32{\%}. Multiple logistic regression analysis identified low household income and unemployment as significant socioeconomic correlates of chronic pain. Chronic pain is prevalent among US adults and is related to indicators of poorer socioeconomic status. PERSPECTIVE The results of this cross-sectional Internet-based survey suggest a considerable burden of chronic pain in US adults. Chronic pain, experienced by about a third of the population, was correlated with indicators of poorer socioeconomic status. Primary chronic pain was most commonly attributed to lower back pain, followed by osteoarthritis pain.},

Confusing terminology and inappropriate use of diagnostic criteria have contributed to this problem. Use of the 1990 ACR Criteria for the Classification of Fibromyalgia together with the symptom and physical examination definitions in that report should go far to correct these problems. Problems of selection and identification bias filter patients with the syndrome, and almost all reports concerning the disorder have been obtained from subspecialty clinics. Almost nothing is known about fibromyalgia in the community, and characteristics of patients noted in the clinic may be a primary function of these biases. In general, in the clinic, about 90{\%} of patients are women of a mean age slightly less than 50 years. Onset is noted in childhood and in old age, but most commonly in middle life. Trauma, surgery, and infection have been noted in association with development of the syndrome in some reports. More than 10{\%} of patients attending general medical clinics and 15-20{\%} attending rheumatology clinics have the syndrome. Chronicity is the rule. Work disability occurs, but most patients seem to be able to work, although some have changed jobs to accomplish this. Psychologic abnormalities are noted in most, but not all, reports, but may reflect selection bias and could be absent in the community.},

Here we show how Bayesian decision theory can account for such features and we describe a model of pain that we tested against experimental data. Our model not only agrees with placebo analgesia, but also predicts that learning can affect pain perception in other unexpected ways, which experimental evidence supports. Finally, the model can also reflect the strategies used by pain perception, showing that modulation by disparate factors is intrinsic to the pain process.},

abstract = {The pain field has been advocating for some time for the importance of teaching people how to live well with pain. Perhaps some, and maybe even for many, we might again consider the possibility that we can help people live well without pain. Explaining Pain (EP) refers to a range of educational interventions that aim to change one's understanding of the biological processes that are thought to underpin pain as a mechanism to reduce pain itself. It draws on educational psychology, in particular conceptual change strategies, to help patients understand current thought in pain biology. The core objective of the EP approach to treatment is to shift one's conceptualization of pain from that of a marker of tissue damage or disease to that of a marker of the perceived need to protect body tissue. Here, we describe the historical context and beginnings of EP, suggesting that it is a pragmatic application of the biopsychosocial model of pain, but differentiating it from cognitive behavioral therapy and educational components of early multidisciplinary pain management programs. We attempt to address common misconceptions of EP that have emerged over the last 15 years, highlighting that EP is not behavioral or cognitive advice, nor does it deny the potential contribution of peripheral nociceptive signals to pain. We contend that EP is grounded in strong theoretical frameworks, that its targeted effects are biologically plausible, and that available behavioral evidence is supportive. We update available meta-analyses with results of a systematic review of recent contributions to the field and propose future directions by which we might enhance the effects of EP as part of multimodal pain rehabilitation. Perspective: EP is a range of educational interventions. EP is grounded in conceptual change and instructional design theory. It increases knowledge of pain-related biology, decreases catastrophizing, and imparts short-term reductions in pain and disability. It presents the biological information that justifies a biopsychosocial approach to rehabilitation.},

abstract = {Until the 1960s, pain was considered an inevitable sensory response to tissue damage. There was little room for the affective dimension of this ubiquitous experience, and none whatsoever for the effects of genetic differences, past experience, anxiety, or expectation. In recent years, great advances have been made in our understanding of the mechanisms that underlie pain and in the treatment of people who complain of pain. The roles of factors outside the patient's body have also been clarified. Pain is probably the most common symptomatic reason to seek medical consultation. All of us have headaches, burns, cuts, and other pains at some time during childhood and adult life. Individuals who undergo surgery are almost certain to have postoperative pain. Ageing is also associated with an increased likelihood of chronic pain. Health-care expenditures for chronic pain are enormous, rivalled only by the costs of wage replacement and welfare programmes for those who do not work because of pain. Despite improved knowledge of underlying mechanisms and better treatments, many people who have chronic pain receive inadequate care.},

@article{Rief2007,
abstract = {We summarize the psychological mechanisms that have been linked to the development and maintenance of medically unexplained symptoms (MUS). Many models postulate that patients with MUS misinterpret physical sensations and show other cognitive abnormalities (e.g., an over-exclusive concept of health) that play a major role in symptom development. While there is strong evidence for the role of cognitive aspects, there is less evidence for their interaction with perceptual features (e.g., perceptual sensitivity, lowered perceptual threshold). Modern neuroimaging techniques show that the expectation of symptoms leads to the activation of brain areas corresponding to symptom perception, while distraction from symptoms reduces brain activity in perception areas. The frequently postulated monocausal organic attribution for physical sensations by patients with MUS needs to be modified, as many patients report multiple symptom attributions, including psychological. Symptom attributions and causal models depend on memorized concepts, and so memory processes need to be investigated in more detail. Aberrations in memory processes not only offer a link to understanding perceptual processes, but are also involved in doctor-patient interaction. This encounter is characterized by unsuccessful medical reassurance, which again involves memory processes. We conclude that psychological mechanisms such as expectation, distraction, and memory processes need to be integrated with biological models to aid understanding of MUS.},

Earlier attention/expectancy effects on symptom reporting were studied when subjects were physically stimulated by the experimenter. If attention or expectancy produced symptom reporting, which plays a role in hypochondriasis, one expects that attention/expectancy will also produce symptoms in the absence of any deliberate physical stimulation. Eighty healthy volunteers were allocated to one of four groups: attention, expectancy, attention plus expectancy or a control condition. Compared to the control condition there was much higher symptom reporting in the 3 experimental groups. The experimental groups did not differ. It is argued that the effects of expectancy are obtained via increased attention. The relevance of the findings for understanding hypochondriasis is discussed.},

The two groups did not differ in their basic pain sensitivity based on their heat pain thresholds. Attentional control was manipulated by a mental arithmetic task, resulting in one experimental condition with distraction and one without distraction. In both of the conditions, subjects rated the intensity and the unpleasantness of nonpainful and painful heat stimuli on visual analog scales (VAS). Distraction significantly reduced the perceived intensity and unpleasantness of the stimuli at painful levels but not at nonpainful levels. Contrary to our expectation, the individual level of hypochondriasis did not influence this result. Although distraction seemed to have a strong influence on pain perception, hypochondriasis as a symptom or a trait did not contribute to this effect.},

In this study, a −20°C rod was placed on one hand for 500ms while we manipulated the evaluative context (or ‘meaning') of, warning about, and visual attention to, the stimulus. For meaning, a red (hot, more tissue damaging) or blue (cold, less tissue damaging) visual cue was used. For warning, the stimulus occurred after the cue or they occurred together. For visual attention, subjects looked towards the stimulus or away from it. Repeated measures ANCOVA was significant ($\alpha$=0.0125). Stimuli associated with a red cue were rated as hot, with the blue cue as cold (difference on an 11 point scale ∼5.5). The red cue also meant the pain was rated as more unpleasant (difference ∼3.5) and more intense (difference ∼3). For stimuli associated with the red cue only, the pain was more unpleasant when the stimulus occurred after the cue than when it didn't (difference ∼1.1). Pain was rated as more intense, and the stimulus as hotter, when subjects looked at the red-cued stimulus than when they didn't (difference ∼0.9 for pain intensity and ∼2 for temperature). We conclude that meaning affects the experience a noxious stimulus evokes, and that warning and visual attention moderate the effects of meaning when the meaning is associated with tissue-damage. Different dimensions of the stimulus' context can have differential effects on sensory-discriminative and affective-emotional components of pain.},

The water load symptom provocation task was used to induce visceral discomfort in pediatric patients with abdominal pain (N=104) and well children (N=119), ages 8–16 years. Parents were randomly assigned and trained to interact with their children according to one of three conditions: Attention, Distraction, or No Instruction. Children's symptom complaints and parents' responses were audiotaped and coded. Children completed a self-report measure of gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms before and after interacting with their parents. Parents' and children's perceptions of their interaction were assessed. Compared to the No Instruction condition, symptom complaints by pain patients and well children nearly doubled in the Attention condition and were reduced by half in the Distraction condition. The effect of attention on symptom complaints was greater for female pain patients than for male patients or well children. Findings for self-report GI symptoms were similar to those for audiotaped symptom complaints. Both pain patients and well children in the Distraction condition rated parents as making them feel better compared to ratings for the Attention condition. Parents of pain patients rated distraction as having greater potential negative impact on their children than attention. Parents' responses to children's symptom complaints can significantly increase or decrease those complaints. Girls with functional abdominal pain are particularly vulnerable to the symptom-reinforcing effects of parental attention.},

abstract = {Doctors frequently encounter patients with somatic symptoms that defy adequate medical explanation. Many such 'medically unexplained symptoms' (MUS) develop into chronic problems associated with considerable distress, disability and resource uti-lization. Despite the importance of this problem, the development of more effective treatments for MUS is hindered by inadequate understanding of the mechanisms of these conditions. Previous models Historically, there have been three basic models of MUS. All of these models have been refined since their initial development, although the basic elements remain in each case. Dissociation The dissociation model assumes that traumatic experiences create a deficit in attention that prevents memories from being integrated with the patient's personality. 1 As the patient has no control over these 'dissociated' memories, they may be activated by internal and external events producing a spontaneous experience of the memory content. Due to the patient's attentional deficit, however, the content is experienced as current reality rather than a memory. Broadly speaking, unexplained symptoms arise when the dissoci-ated memories are of somatic sensations. Consistent with the dissociation model, research has found that MUS patients often report early traumatic experiences. There is also some evidence of attentional deficits and of dissociations between different forms of cognitive processing in patients with MUS. Research in this area remains limited, particularly as there are doubts about how dissociation should be defined and measured. 2},

This study presents data from a pilot clinical trial of a six-week manualized mindfulness meditation intervention offered to 20 adolescents aged 13–17 years. Measures of pain intensity, functional disability, depression and parent worry about their child's pain were obtained at baseline and post-treatment. Results indicated no significant changes in pain or depression, however functional disability and frequency of pain functioning complaints improved with small effect sizes. Parents' worry about child's pain significantly decreased with a large effect size. Participants rated intervention components positively and most teens suggested that the number of sessions be increased. Three case examples illustrate mindfulness meditation effects and precautions. Mindfulness meditation shows promise as a feasible and acceptable intervention for youth with chronic pain. Future research should optimize intervention components and determine treatment efficacy.},

Information was gathered from 149 adolescents (ages 10–17) presenting for evaluation and treatment at interdisciplinary pain clinics in the United States. Parents completed a validated measure of family economic attributes, the Client Service Receipt In-ventory, to report on health service use and productivity losses due to their child's chronic pain retro-spectively over 12 months. Health care costs were calculated by multiplying reported utilization estimates by unit visit costs from the 2010 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey.

An estimated 10-55{\%} of all adults are thought to have chronic pain. Chronic pain is a multifactorial condition, caused by the complex interplay of nociceptive, neuropathic or mixed pathogenic mechanisms. Chronic pain is associated with specific and non-specific medical conditions such as cancer, HIV/AIDS, rheumatoid arthritis, fibromyalgia, osteoarthritis, low back pain or spinal stenosis and is broadly categorized as cancer pain and non-cancer pain. Evaluation of chronic pain requires a clear understanding of the nature of the pain and its underlying pathophysiology. Adequate assessment of pain, using validated tools, is an essential prerequisite of successful pain management. Unidimensional scales are useful for the measurement of pain intensity, while multidimensional scales measure both pain intensity and the extent to which pain interferes with life activity and emotional functioning.

In this review we evaluatesome of the principle processes that may be altered as a consequence of chronic pain in the context of localized and integrated neural networks.

abstract = {Chronic pain is the most burdensome health issue facing the world today; its cost to Western countries is comparable with that of diabetes and cancer combined. 21 Our understanding of the pathophysiology of chronic pain has increased substantially over the past 20 years, including but not limited to changes in the brain. 23 However, we still do not know why chronic pain develops in some people and not in others, although we do know that the type or extent of their injury, personality, occupation, postcode, education level, race, or religion are not strong predictors. 6 Extensive research into the genetics of chronic pain has also thus far been underwhelming, perhaps because too many genes are involved and results are conflicting. 12 Chronic pain is very difficult to treat; 60{\%} of those with chronic pain will still be in pain after 1 year. 7 It seems that despite extensive advances in multiple fields, we have made little ground. In this topical review, we put forward a new hypothesis of chronic pain that explains the most common painful disorders, such as chronic widespread pain, nonspecific back or neck pain, and fibromyalgia. Our hypothesis draws on a long history of fundamental research in associative learning and is based on 2 core assumptions (1) that pain can be considered a response, not just a stimulus, and (2) that encoding non-nociceptive information predictably coincident with nociceptive input underpins the response to subsequent similar events. Briefly, our hypothesis posits that the precision with which multisensory information (temporal, proprioceptive, spatial) about the painful event is encoded and represented in the brain will determine the degree to which the painful response will subsequently generalize to similar events. Much of the literature on pain considers it analogous to nociception, activity in high-threshold afferent neurons and their central projections. However, a very large body of evidence demonstrates that nociception is neither sufficient nor necessary for pain (see Refs. 4,11,22). Pain is now considered a conscious experience that can be, and often is, associated with nociception, but it is always modulated by a myriad of neurobiological, environmental, and cognitive factors. Plasticity, or the alterations in stimulus–response patterns that occur over time, is thought to be important in chronic pain and can occur in at least 2 ways. One is nonassociative when the organism's response to a stimulus changes by virtue of repeated exposure to that particular stimulus. Habituation is 1 example of nonassociative plasticity, such that the response to a given stimulus decreases. Sensitization is another example, such that the response to a given stimulus increases. Sensitization of spinal nociceptors is considered a key mechanism underpinning persistent pain after primary nerve trauma or dysfunction; repeated noxious stimula-tion leads to a shift in the stimulus–response pattern of the spinal nociceptor. A second arguably more complex form of plasticity involves the association of at least 2 stimuli, such is the typical case of classical (Pavlovian) conditioning or associative learning.},

abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To present an overview of insights into brain mechanisms of pain perception and analgesia based on human brain imaging.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRECENT FINDINGS: The technical advancement made in both functional and structural MRI can be used to delineate the cerebral signature of pain and analgesia, specifically, the brain responses to noxious stimuli and specific pain-related forebrain responses, as well as pain modulatory effects. Neuroimaging has revealed that the brain response to noxious stimuli shares neural resources with other systems that subserve salience detection and reward functions. Recent findings indicate that there is a wide range of individual differences in pain-related brain function and structure due to both pre-existing vulnerabilities and disease-driven factors. Furthermore, several studies now illustrate that the brain is capable of tremendous plasticity both in function and structure due to repeated and ongoing pain. However, emerging data suggest that this plasticity can be reversible after successful pain treatment.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nSUMMARY: Neuroimaging of pain and plasticity can provide a framework to understand the basic mechanisms of pain regarding function, gray and white matter structure and connectivity. This information may also guide future clinical practice. For instance, the time-course of disease-driven brain plasticity and capacity for reversibility may help decide the optimal time frame for chronic pain treatment. Furthermore, findings from functional and structural connectivity studies may indicate potential side effects of targeting specific brain areas in treating chronic pain. Lastly, the correlation between individual factors and functional/structural MRI data may direct individualized treatment plans.},

abstract = {One contribution of 16 to a theme issue 'Interoception beyond homeostasis: affect, cognition and mental health'. We review a recent shift in conceptions of interoception and its relationship to hierarchical inference in the brain. The notion of interoceptive inference means that bodily states are regulated by autonomic reflexes that are enslaved by descending predictions from deep generative models of our internal and exter-nal milieu. This re-conceptualization illuminates several issues in cognitive and clinical neuroscience with implications for experiences of selfhood and emotion. We first contextualize interoception in terms of active (Bayesian) inference in the brain, highlighting its enactivist (embodied) aspects. We then consider the key role of uncertainty or precision and how this might translate into neuromodulation. We next examine the implications for understanding the functional anatomy of the emotional brain, surveying recent observations on agranular cortex. Finally, we turn to theoretical issues, namely, the role of interoception in shaping a sense of embodied self and feelings. We will draw links between physiological homoeostasis and allostasis, early cybernetic ideas of predictive control and hierarchical generative models in predictive processing. The explanatory scope of interoceptive inference ranges from expla-nations for autism and depression, through to consciousness. We offer a brief survey of these exciting developments.

Here, we provide empirical support for dissociation between dimensions of: (1) interoceptive accuracy (performance on objective behavioural tests of heartbeat detection), (2) interoceptive sensibility (self-evaluated assessment of subjective interoception, gauged using interviews/questionnaires) and (3) interoceptive awareness (metacognitive awareness of interoceptive accuracy, e.g. confidence-accuracy correspondence). In a normative sample (. N=. 80), all three dimensions were distinct and dissociable. Interoceptive accuracy was only partly predicted by interoceptive awareness and interoceptive sensibility. Significant correspondence between dimensions emerged only within the sub-group of individuals with greatest interoceptive accuracy. These findings set the context for defining how the relative balance of accuracy, sensibility and awareness dimensions explain cognitive, emotional and clinical associations of interoceptive ability.},

abstract = {Psychiatric disorders such as autism and schizophrenia, arise from abnormalities in brain systems that un-derlie cognitive, emotional, and social functions. The brain is enormously complex and its abundant feedback loops on multiple scales preclude intuitive explication of circuit functions. In close interplay with experiments, theory and computational modeling are essential for understanding how, precisely, neural circuits generate flexible behaviors and their impairments give rise to psychiatric symptoms. This Perspective highlights recent progress in applying computational neuroscience to the study of mental disorders. We outline basic approaches, including identification of core deficits that cut across disease categories, biologically realistic modeling bridging cellular and synaptic mechanisms with behavior, and model-aided diagnosis. The need for new research strategies in psychiatry is urgent. Computational psychiatry potentially provides powerful tools for elucidating pathophysiology that may inform both diagnosis and treatment. To achieve this promise will require investment in cross-disciplinary training and research in this nascent field. Introduction In 1988, a computational neuroscience ''manifesto'' (Sejnowski et al., 1988) mentioned three reasons for the emergence of this new research field: advances in neuroscience had generated a large body of neurophysiologic data, new computers possessed sufficient power to conduct neural model simulations, and simplified brain models were introduced that provided insights into complex neural circuit functions. Since then, dramatic ad-vances made on all three fronts fundamentally changed the computational neuroscience landscape (Abbott, 2008). Notably, computational neuroscience initially focused on the early stages of sensory processing (Sejnowski et al., 1988), because studies of the neural bases of higher cognitive functions were beyond empirical neuroscience of that era. Indeed, only in recent years has the confluence of single-unit physiology, human functional brain imaging, and advances in computational modeling made significant strides in tackling executive functions (such as working memory and decision making) that underlie cognitively controlled flexible behavior. These higher functions critically depend on the prefrontal cortex (PFC) (Fuster, 2008; Miller and Cohen, 2001; Wang, 2013; Szczepanski and Knight, 2014). Because impairments of the PFC and related circuits are impli-cated in major psychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia and autism (Goldman-Rakic, 1994; Insel, 2010; Courchesne et al., 2011; Anticevic et al., 2013a), the newly acquired insights and computational models offer an opportunity to elucidate how cellular and circuit level pathologies give rise to cognitive deficits observed in mental illness, advances in this direction could inform studies of psychiatric diagnosis, pathophysiology and treatment. Therefore, the time is ripe for computational psychiatry to emerge as a field at the interface between basic and clinical},

abstract = {AIMS To describe and quantify impairment in an outpatient population of children with chronic pain of unknown origin (UCP). METHODS A total of 149 children who presented with pain of at least three months' duration and without a satisfactory explanation at presentation were studied. Number of somatic complaints (Children's Somatisation Inventory, CSI), pain intensity (VAS, 0-10 cm), functional disability (Child Health Questionnaire (CHQ-CF) and clinical history), and general health perceptions (CHQ) were determined. RESULTS Mean age of the children was 11.8 years; 73{\%} were girls. Overall, 72{\%} suffered impairment in sports activities, 51{\%} reported absence from school, 40{\%} experienced limitations in social functioning, and 34{\%} had problems with sleeping. Mean number of somatic symptoms differed significantly between boys (8.4) and girls (10.7). The CHQ-CF scores for physical functioning, role/social functioning, and general health perceptions were 76.4, 70.7, and 57.5, respectively, indicating substantial impairment on all domains. The mean pain intensity was 4.7 for current and 7.1 for worst pain. Children solely evaluated by a general practitioner prior to referral reported less, though still substantial, impairment. Low general health perceptions, impaired role/social functioning, high pain intensity, and having headache or musculoskeletal pain were independent predictors of having significant impairment.

abstract = {Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) interventions show promise for decreasing chronic pain in youth. However, the availability of CBT is limited by many factors including distance to major treatment centers and expense. This study evaluates a more accessible treatment approach for chronic pediatric pain using an Internet-delivered family CBT intervention. Participants included 48 children, aged 11-17 years, with chronic headache, abdominal, or musculoskeletal pain and associated functional disability, and their parents. Children were randomly assigned to a wait-list control group or an Internet treatment group. Primary treatment outcomes were pain intensity ratings (0-10 NRS) and activity limitations on the Child Activity Limitations Interview, both completed via an online daily diary. In addition to their medical care, the Internet treatment group completed 8 weeks of online modules including relaxation training, cognitive strategies, parent operant techniques, communication strategies, and sleep and activity interventions. Youth randomized to the wait-list control group continued with the current medical care only. Findings demonstrated significantly greater reduction in activity limitations and pain intensity at post-treatment for the Internet treatment group and these effects were maintained at the three-month follow-up. Rate of clinically significant improvement in pain was also greater for the Internet treatment group than for the wait-list control group. There were no significant group differences in parental protectiveness or child depressive symptoms post-treatment. Internet treatment was rated as acceptable by all children and parents. Findings support the efficacy and acceptability of Internet delivery of family CBT for reducing pain and improving function among children and adolescents with chronic pain. {\textcopyright} 2009 International Association for the Study of Pain.},

abstract = {A systematic review and subset meta-analysis of published randomised controlled trials of psychological therapies for children and adolescents with chronic pain is reported. A search of four computerised abstracting services recovered 123 papers from which 28 potential trials were identified. Eighteen met the criteria for inclusion in the review. The majority of these papers reported brief behavioural and cognitive behavioural interventions for children with headache and many were conducted in community (i.e. school) settings. Meta-analysis was applicable for 12 headache trials and one trial of recurrent abdominal pain using the Pain Index. The odds-ratio for a 50{\%} reduction in pain was 9.62 and the number needed to treat was 2.32, indicating that the psychological treatments examined are effective in reducing the pain of headache. The quality of the 18 trials retrieved is narratively reviewed and suggestions for the development of trials in this field are made. {\textcopyright} 2002 International Association for the Study of Pain.

abstract = {The purpose of this meta-analytic review was to quantify the effects of psychological therapies for the management of chronic pain in youth. Specifically, in this review we updated previous systematic reviews of randomized controlled trials by including new trials, and by adding disability and emotional functioning to pain as treatment outcomes. Electronic searches of the Cochrane Register of Randomised Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, PsycLIT, EMBASE, and the Social Sciences Citation Index were conducted from inception through August 2008. Methodological quality of the studies was assessed, and data extracted on the three primary outcomes of interest. Twenty-five trials including 1247 young people met inclusion criteria and were included in the meta-analysis. Meta-analytic findings demonstrated a large positive effect of psychological intervention on pain reduction at immediate post-treatment and follow-up in youth with headache, abdominal pain, and fibromyalgia. Small and non-significant effects were found for improvements in disability and emotional functioning, although there were limited data on these outcomes available in the included studies. Omnibus cognitive-behavioral therapy, relaxation therapy, and biofeedback all produced significant and positive effects on pain reduction. Studies directly comparing the effects of self-administered versus therapist-administered interventions found similar effects on pain reduction. Psychological therapies result in improvement in pain relief across several different pain conditions in children. Future trials are needed that incorporate non-pain outcome domains, that focus significant therapeutic content on reductions in disability, and that include extended follow-up to better understand maintenance of treatment effects. {\textcopyright} 2009 International Association for the Study of Pain.},

abstract = {Several studies have used neuroimaging techniques to investigate brain correlates of the attentional modulation of pain. Although these studies have advanced the knowledge in the field, important confounding factors such as imprecise theoretical definitions of attention, incomplete operationalization of the construct under exam, and limitations of techniques relying on measuring regional changes in cerebral blood flow have hampered the potential relevance of the conclusions. Here, we first provide an overview of the major theories of attention and of attention in the study of pain to bridge theory and experimental results. We conclude that load and motivational/affective theories are particularly relevant to study the attentional modulation of pain and should be carefully integrated in functional neuroimaging studies. Then, we summarize previous findings and discuss the possible neural correlates of the attentional modulation of pain. We discuss whether classical functional neuroimaging techniques are suitable to measure the effect of a fluctuating process like attention, and in which circumstances functional neuroimaging can be reliably used to measure the attentional modulation of pain. Finally, we argue that the analysis of brain networks and spontaneous oscillations may be a crucial future development in the study of attentional modulation of pain, and why the interplay between attention and pain, as examined so far, may rely on neural mechanisms shared with other sensory modalities.},

abstract = {Many chronic pain syndromes are associated with hypersensitivity to painful stimuli and with reduced endogenous pain inhibition. These findings suggest that modulation of pain-related information may be linked to the onset or maintenance of chronic pain. The combination of heightened pain sensitivity and reduced pain inhibition seems to predispose individuals to greater risk for increased acute clinical pain. It is unknown whether such pain processing abnormalities may also place individuals at increased risk for chronic pain. Psychophysical methods can be used for the evaluation of pain sensitivity and pain inhibition. Long-term prospective studies that could yield insight into the role of heightened pain sensitivity and pain disinhibition for the development of chronic pain disorders like fibromyalgia in the general population are lacking, however. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Inc.

@article{Karshikoff2016,
abstract = {Low-grade systemic inflammation has been implicated in chronic pain, as well as in comorbid diseases like depression and fatigue. We have previously shown that women's pain perception and regulation is more affected by systemic inflammation than that of men. Here we investigated the neural substrates underlying these effects using an fMRI paradigm previously employed in a clinical population. Fifty-one participants (29 women) were injected with 0.6 ng/kg lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or saline to induce a peripheral inflammatory response. The subjects were then tested with a pressure pain fMRI paradigm designed to capture descending pain inhibitory activity 2 h after injection, and blood was sampled for cytokine analysis. The subjects injected with LPS became more pain sensitive compared to the placebo group, and the heightened pain sensitivity was paralleled by decreased activity in the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex and the rostral anterior cingulate cortex (rACC) compared to placebo; areas involved in descending pain regulation. The LPS group also had higher activity in the anterior insular cortex, an area underpinning affective and interoceptive pain processing. Women displayed overall less pain-evoked rACC activity compared to men, which may have rendered women less resilient to immune provocation, possibly explaining sex differences in LPS-induced pain sensitivity. Our findings elucidate the pain-related brain circuits affected by experimental peripheral inflammation, strengthening the theoretical link between systemic inflammation and weakened pain regulation in chronic pain disorders. The results further suggest a possible mechanism underlying the female predominance in many chronic pain disorders.},
